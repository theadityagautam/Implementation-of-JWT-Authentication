This repository demonstrates JWT Authentication implementation in a Spring Boot 3 application. It covers user registration, login, and securing API endpoints using token-based authentication. With Spring Security, it provides a stateless solution for modern web applications, ensuring secure communication and identity verification.

## Features

- **Token-based Authentication**: Secure your Spring Boot application using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Spring Security Integration**: Leverage Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA with MySQL**: Store and retrieve user information using Spring Data JPA with MySQL database.
- **Maven Build**: Simplify project management and dependency resolution with Maven.
- **Easy to Use**: A well-structured example with detailed comments for easy understanding.

## Prerequisites
